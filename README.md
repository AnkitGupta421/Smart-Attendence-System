## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get your Smart Attendence System up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes npm)

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Smart-Attendence-System/Smart-Attendence-System.git
cd Smart-Attendence-System
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration

If your project requires specific environment variables (e.g., for `apple-signin` configuration), create a `.env` file in the root directory and add them:

```ini
# .env example
APPLE_CLIENT_ID=your_apple_client_id
APPLE_TEAM_ID=your_apple_team_id
APPLE_KEY_ID=your_apple_key_id
APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_apple_private_key_content
```

### Run the Application

Once dependencies are installed and configuration is complete, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be accessible in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address.


## üí° Usage Examples

The Smart Attendence System provides a straightforward interface for managing attendance.

### Basic Attendance Marking

Users can navigate to the main attendance page and click a designated button to mark their presence.

```javascript
// Example of how attendance might be marked on the client-side
// (This is a simplified representation for demonstration)

document.getElementById('markAttendanceBtn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/attend', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' // Assuming authentication
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ timestamp: new Date().toISOString() })
        });

        if (response.ok) {
            alert('Attendance marked successfully!');
            // Update UI to reflect marked attendance
        } else {
            const errorData = await response.json();
            alert(`Failed to mark attendance: ${errorData.message}`);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error marking attendance:', error);
        alert('An error occurred while marking attendance.');
    }
});
```

### Configuration Options

While the primary interface is web-based, server-side configurations can be adjusted.

| Option             | Description                                          | Default Value |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| `PORT`             | The port on which the server will run.               | `3000`        |
| `DATABASE_URL`     | Connection string for the database (if applicable).  | `N/A`         |
| `SESSION_SECRET`   | Secret key for session management.                   | `random_string` |
